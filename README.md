# From-Bacteria-to-Beef

For volunteers who are interested in selling their bacteria to Improbable Beef, some of them will be suitable for synthetic beef production, while others will not. What is the best way to visualize the types of bacteria that colonize their bellies, how to best convey data to volunteers and other researchers? Learning to use Plotly will be an important first step.  

## Results 
##### Dynamic webpage for volunteers: https://shiraliobul.github.io/BellyButton-Bacteria/
volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

The snapshot of the webpage is the following:
